### What I learned

In this project, the correct positioning of background images and correctly aligning the absolute elements were the hardest things for me, but I think that in the end - I managed to do it right. I'm longing for doing some logic with JS, I had a bit too much CSS i guess. Or maybe I should finally try Tailwind.

```css
  background-image: url('../assets/bg-main-mobile.png');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top -225px right -225px;

  @media screen and (min-width: 650px) {
    background-image: url('../assets/bg-main-tablet.png');
    background-position: top -350px right -225px;
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: 1050px) {
    background-image: url('../assets/bg-main-desktop.png');
  }
```
